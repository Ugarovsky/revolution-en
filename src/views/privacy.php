    <p>By clicking on "Continue", you are giving us permission to send you emails about our offers. If you chose not to
        receive any more emails, you can always opt out at any time at the bottom of each email.</p>
    <p>
        The Software respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites. This privacy statement provides
        notice of the standards and terms under which The Software protects the privacy of information supplied by
        visitors
        to sites on the World Wide Web that are owned and operated by The Software, including The Software and The
        Software.
        This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your
        information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review
        this
        information.
    </p>
    <h2>
        A. Personally-Identifiable Information:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Software typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided
        voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer
        support
        inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of
        these
        activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for
        services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable
        information to The Software through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In
        most
        cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want The Software to use this
        information for additional purposes. You may also request that The Software not use your information by sending
        an
        e-mail to: support@fxrevenge.net, however, The Software reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you
        bulletins
        and other important information about your The Software services. Absent any instructions from you, The Software
        may
        use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by the The Software
        family
        of companies, The Software authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom The Software has
        relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. The Software will not, however, sell or trade
        your
        personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of
        imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those The Software sites where you may provide The Software
        with
        credit card or other ordering information via the web, The Software protects and secures this information by
        employing commercially customary web- based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure
        Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any
        feedback,
        data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, The Software will treat that portion of the
        information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement,
        The
        Software assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.

    <p>
        Examples in these materials are not to be taken as a promise or guarantee of earnings. Earning potential is
        entirely
        dependent on the person using our product, ideas, techniques and the effort put forth. We do not purport this as
        a
        "get rich scheme", and nor should you view it as such.
    </p>
    <h2>
        B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information:
    </h2>
    <p>
        In general, The Software gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does not reveal the
        identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer,
        the
        number and frequency of visitors, and the The Software sites visited. The Software gathers this information for
        the
        limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain
        technologies,
        including "cookies" (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about The
        Software services). The Software does not combine information collected in this way with any
        personally-identifiable
        information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        C. Your The Software hosted website, server, bulletin boards, forum, Third-Party Sites:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Information that you disclose in a public space, including on any bulletin board, chat room, or website The
        Software
        may host for you as part of your The Software services, is available to anyone else who visits that space. The
        Software cannot safeguard any information you disclose in these locations. Additionally, The Software websites
        contain links to sites that belong to third parties unrelated to The Software. The Software cannot protect any
        information you may disclose in these sites and recommends that you review the privacy policy statements of
        those
        sites you visit.
    </p>
    <h2>
        D. Exceptions and Limitations:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing and in compliance with applicable laws, The Software (i) cooperates fully with
        state,
        local, and federal officials in any investigation relating to any content (including personal or private
        electronic
        communications transmitted to The Software) or purported unlawful activities of any user of the Service, and
        (ii)
        takes reasonable measures to protect its proprietary rights. For the limited purposes of accomplishing such
        cooperation and measures and in compliance with applicable laws, The Software may be required to disclose
        personally
        identifiable information. In addition, The Software may elect to monitor the areas of communication of any kind
        (i)
        to satisfy any law, regulation, or government request; (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to
        operate The Software; or (iii) to protect the rights or property of The Software or others. In connection with
        the
        potential sale or transfer of any of its interest in The Software and The Software and other sites owned by the
        company, The Software reserves the right to sell or transfer your information (including , but not limited to
        name,
        address information, and other information you provided to The Software) to a third party that (i) concentrates
        its
        business in communication products or services; (ii) agrees to be The Software's successor in interest with
        regard
        to the maintenance and protection of information collected and maintained by The Software; and (iii) agrees to
        the
        obligations of this policy statement.
