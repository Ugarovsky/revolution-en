        <p class="invest-ph">In 2017, a group of veteran traders teamed up with renowned economists and accomplished mathematicians to develop a day trading software that will trade the crypto markets with full automation. This marked the start of the <a href="?lp=1">Bitcoin Revolution</a> journey, a software that has now practically established itself as the most popular crypto software in the world.</p>
        <p class="invest-ph">The actual identity of the Bitcoin Revolution inventors has remained unknown, but the performance of the software is out there for every investor to see. The software has helped investors of all levels to earn consistent profits out of the cryptocurrency market, with minimal intervention required.</p>
        <p class="invest-ph">The software has a user-friendly interface that is easily navigable even for new and inexperienced investors. Top traders had great input into the overall strategy implemented by the Bitcoin Revolution, but top FinTech technologies have also been applied to ensure that the software trades the crypto market with a near-perfect success rate. It is no doubt that the guarantee of consistent profits is the major reason why investors rank THE Bitcoin Revolution as the best crypto trading software in the world.</p><img src="../assets/robot.png" srcset="../assets/robot-p-500.png 500w, ../assets/robot.png 546w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 94vw, (max-width: 574px) 95vw, 546px" alt class="invest-img-left">
        <p class="invest-ph mt-30">When trading with the Bitcoin Revolution, investors have the option to use Manual or Automatic modes. You can toggle between the modes, depending on your trading needs, experience as well as prevailing market conditions.</p>
        <p class="invest-ph">The manual mode is intended for experienced traders who desire to retain a great degree of control over their trading activities. In this mode, the Bitcoin Revolution generates quality high probability trading signals, but it is the investor that decides whether the signals should be executed in the market. This may be ideal for the more experienced traders, but the obvious disadvantage is that the time lag in execution can impact on overall profit levels.</p>
        <p class="invest-ph">In contrast, the automatic mode can be utilised by both new and experienced traders. Virtually no human intervention is required when trading in automatic mode, but investors still have the option of altering trading parameters, such as trading times and trade amount as well as stop loss and profit target levels. All in all, the automatic mode of the Bitcoin Revolution represents the application of the inventors’ strategies at their best.</p>

        <h2 class="scam-main-title">Bitcoin Revolution Scam Review</h2><img src="../assets/notebook.png" alt class="scam-img">
        <p class="scam-ph">Automated trading represents the best way to trade any strategy in the market. It is no wonder that most investors are now looking to go the automation way so as to boost their profit margins.</p>
        <p class="scam-ph">Bitcoin Revolution offers such a solution.</p>
        <p class="scam-ph">It is an automated cryptocurrency trading software that was developed and launched in 2017. The software applies multiple advanced trading strategies to trade cryptocurrencies with amazing accuracy levels.</p>
        <p class="scam-ph">Using top technologies as well, the Bitcoin Revolution is able to stay ahead of the markets by 0.01 seconds, thereby guaranteeing maximum profits for investors. We review below whether the software lives up to its hype or it is simply just another scam!</p>
        <h3 class="scam-subtitle">Bitcoin Revolution: Legit or Scam?</h3>
        <p class="scam-ph">Automated trading software enhances trading activity compared to manual strategies. Such software eliminates subjective human emotions out of the trading decision-making loop and ensures that a strategy is implemented at its optimal best in the market. Still, there are always some doubts about the authenticity of software that posts high success rates, such as the Bitcoin Revolution.<br>There are numerous positive reviews of the software online, most of them from trusted and verifiable users. But some critics have also raised some concerns such as the reason why the identities of founders are not revealed as well as the underlying strategies the software trades with. Nonetheless, it is understandable why the founders would want to protect their identities in this open, digital world; and it is not uncommon for most automated software developers to develop black-box strategies.</p>
        <p class="scam-ph">Yet, the founders have also let out the reason why the Bitcoin Revolution manages to trade with high accuracy levels. The time leap feature allows the software to stay ahead of the markets by 0.01 seconds, while VPN functionality guarantees the best execution at all times.</p>
        <p class="scam-ph">With numerous unethical persons around, it is important to take due care when choosing an automated trading software. But in every aspect, the Bitcoin Revolution has performed admirably when subjected to our Scam Test. Numerous investors who started out with just $250, are now making daily profits of at least $1,000 and withdrawing any time they wish to.</p><a href="#formTop" class="btn-blue mt-20 w-button">START TRADING NOW</a></div>
