        entity to
        the fullest extent permissible by law and in equity. </p>

    <h2 class="upper-case">Choice of law/venue </h2>

    <p>Any disputes arising out of or related to the Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
        laws of Estonia (without regard to conflict of law principles). Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive
        to
        the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall
        be
        construed to preclude any party from seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome
        in
        arbitration. To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class
        action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against TheSoftware. and each of their
        legal representatives, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, agencies and their respective members, officers,
        directors, employees and agents. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove
        you
        as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that TheSoftwareurs in
        seeking
        such relief. The Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights and remedies to pursue a claim
        individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above. This provision preventing you
        from
        bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement. Should any part of the
        Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and
        the
        remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. </p>
