    <h2 class="faq-section-header text-center dark-purple bold">How Bitcoin changed everything</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="./assets/history3.png" style="float:right;" alt="" id="cis">
    <p>The story of Bitcoin starts in mid-2008, when the financial crisis of 2007-2008 was still in full swing. It was then that the domain Bitcoin.org was registered by person or group operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. This is when the process of peer-to-peer digital currencies was first defined.</p>
    <p>The first ever Bitcoin was mined almost one year later, in 2009. The cryptocurrency was worth just a few cents back then, which might come as a surprise to anyone familiar with its current value. The first major Bitcoin milestone came in May of 2010, when an enthusiastic miner used 10,000 BTC to purchase two pizzas online. That amount alone would be worth millions of dollars today, and May 22nd is still celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day in the mining community.</p>
    <p>Following this historical event, Bitcoin exchanges appeared and investors were now buying and selling the crypto like any other regular currency on the forex market. Another essential milestone in the history of Bitcoin occured in 2013, when the value of all existing Bitcoins was estimated at one billion dollars. The crypto hit its peak in 2017, when one single unit was worth just under $20,000 dollars ant the total value of all available Bitcoins was of 334 billion dollars.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience on the foreign exchange market even in the face of adversity such as restrictive regulations or hacking. Its value remains remarkable today and more high-profile investors are joining in, which goes to show that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.</p>

    <h2 class="faq-section-header text-center dark-purple bold">What are Cryptocurrencies?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that operate independently from governments, financial institutions, or other regulatory bodies that usually control transactions. The way their worth is defined is simple and that not much different from the way we evaluate traditional currency. Simply put, the more people invest in cryptocurrencies, the more their value goes up.</p>
    <p>Making a profit with Bitcoin trading functions the same as trading euros or dollars. You buy the crypto when its price is low and sell it when it goes up. Bitcoin (BTC) is the most famous cryptocurrency on the market, but other popular examples you can trade right here on the Bitcoin Revolution software include Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), and Monero (XMR).</p>

                    <span class="faq-question light-purple bold" data-i18n>1. What is Bitcoin and how much is it worth?</span>
                    <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>
                    Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency known as cryptocurrency in the trading world. While its functions are similar to those of traditional currency, Bitcoin is not centralized by a bank or a financial authority, which gives investors full control over transactions. Other than that, you can use it just like you would any other currency.
                    </p>
                    <p>Single units of Bitcoin are stored as computer files in digital wallet apps that can be managed from any mobile or desktop device. Bitcoins or percentages of a single Bitcoin can be sent to your wallet or to other people, and these transactions are recorded on a public list known as the blockchain.</p>
                    <p>
                    As for the value of Bitcoin, it’s no secret that it increased considerably over the years. When the cryptocurrency first hit the market in 2009, a single unit was appraised at less than $1. By 2014, one Bitcoin was worth $700, and at the end of 2017 it hit an outstanding $20,000 per unit. By the end of 2020, its value per unit could double, which is why many traders invest in Bitcoin nowadays in order to make a profit.

                    <h2 class="faq-question light-purple bold" data-i18n>2. How do Bitcoin and Bitcoin Revolution work?</h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>Bitcoins are essentially secure and encrypted blocks of data that have financial value just like regular money does. Therefore, cryptocurrencies can be used in similar ways. For example, when purchasing an item or multiple items with Bitcoin, the currency is transferred from the buyer to the seller just like euros or dollars would be. Thus, Bitcoins can be exchanged for various goods and services, or even cash, and this is exactly why they are so valuable.</p>
                    <p>Traders who invest in Bitcoin are known as “miners”, and this is exactly what the Bitcoin Revolution platform can help you become. Joining the official website means that you can start transactioning cryptocurrency on the foreign exchange market automatically or manually, and thus mine Bitcoin for a profit.</p>

                    <span class="faq-question light-purple bold" data-i18n>3. Is Bitcoin legal everywhere in the world?</span>
                    <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>
                    Bitcoin is legal in many countries around the globe, including The United States of America, Canada, Australia, and the European Union. However, each region has the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies independently from decisions taken in other parts of the globe. Therefore, you should always check local laws before starting to mine Bitcoin or any other crypto for a profit. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, Bitcoin Revolution software is 100% legal and certified. The foreign exchange market is moving at a more rapid pace than ever before, which is why smart brokers rely on successful algorithms like the one provided by our app. Using the Bitcoin Revolution genuine platform for trading cryptos eliminates time wasted on taking decisions and making manual calculations. After all, we all know that time is money, and this is particularly true when it comes to the foreign exchange market.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>
                    Not at all. No prior trading experience is required when using the Bitcoin Revolution software, as you will not be buying and selling to and from a foreign exchange. Instead, you will be handling Bitcoin Contracts for Differences, or CFDs for short. This means that all you have to do is speculate on the price of Bitcoin and earn money when guessing price fluctuation points.
