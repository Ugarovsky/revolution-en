        <h2 class="dark-purple bold how-it-works-header">Bitcoin trading: Real or scam?</h2>
        <p>As cryptocurrency has risen in popularity over the years, increasing numbers of scammers have sought to exploit the public’s lack of knowledge surrounding its trade. These have taken the form of everything, from artificial market prices to fake advertorials on news sites. </p>
        <p>However, automated bitcoin trading is a very real and potentially profitable venture that has worked successfully for investors, time and time again. </p>
        <p>There are two ways to deal bitcoin: you can either buy the cryptocurrency itself with the idea of selling it on at a profit when it increases in value, or you can speculate on its value without ever having come into contact with a single bitcoin. The latter is how spread betting and CFDs work.</p>
        <p>The process of spread betting involves speculating on whether a market will rise or fall in price. A CFD enables you to trade a contract based on prices in the underlying market. Both are leveraged products, meaning you can put down a small initial deposit of just $250 and still manage to gain the exposure of a much larger position. In turn, this can magnify your profits and earn you a lot of money, completely legally and legitimately.</p>
        <p>What’s more, we take absolutely no fees whatsoever, from commissions to handling fees for withdrawals. That means that 100% of the money that you earn, as well as your initial deposit is all yours to keep whether you withdraw it after a day or after a year.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin Era is a fully verified trading platform that uses the market’s most innovative and advanced software to provide a safe and secure space for trading. We have a proven track record of success, which includes hundreds of satisfied users from across the country who have seen their investments turned into a healthy and sustainable profit.</p>
        <p>Investments in bitcoin are generally considered one of the most successful and consistently profitable to make due to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin Era exists with this in mind and with the express aim of sharing our knowledge and maximizing profit for traders, both novices and experts.</p>

        <h2 class="dark-purple bold how-it-works-header">The history of bitcoin</h2>
        <p>Despite being around since 2009, until 2013 few people had heard of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It lived in relative obscurity, talked about mostly within online forums and used chiefly for purchases on the deep web. </p>
        <p>Yet five years after its launch, bitcoin started to take off. The cryptocurrency started the year trading at around $13.50 per bitcoin, before rallying to over $1,000 by the end of November caused by new bitcoin exchanges and miners in China entering the marketplace. The price fluctuated somewhat after that, falling to lows of $315 and highs of $1,079.</p>
        <p>Then, in the fall of 2017, bitcoin began to experience a meteoric rise which saw it break through the $5,000 mark, before doubling in November to $10,000. In December, the value of a single bitcoin was at $20,000, its highest ever.</p>
        <p>Since this peak, bitcoin has continued to be extremely volatile, seeing a number of surges and falls. However, a number of experts believe that bitcoin is still a long way off its full price potential, meaning there is plenty of reason for investment.</p>
        <p>Found of the multi-million dollar virus protection firm, John McAfee, argues that due to bitcoin’s scarcity, it has the potential to hit values of more than $1 million. American venture capitalist Tim Draper also considers bitcoin to be a wise investment, stating that a prediction of a 25-fold increase in value over the next few years would be an understatement.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin continues to be the most valuable and popular cryptocurrency in the world, with many who hold even .1 of a bitcoin likely to earn a significant amount over time. While other currencies tend to increase or decrease in value by small increments, as we have seen over the last decade, bitcoin is a highly volatile form of digital currency. With volatility comes great money-making opportunities when the right resources are used.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin Era understands the nature of cryptocurrency and responds to bitcoin’s volatility instantly in order to maximise results. Signing up is simple and secure, allowing users to take advantage of quick verification so that they can begin trading and making money immediately. It requires no previous experience trading currencies. Sign up  <a href="http://localhost:8000/src/views">here</a></p>

        <p>Getting a feel for the platform, particularly if you’ve never traded before is paramount, which is why Bitcoin Era allows its users to test their skills and adjust settings to their preferences before making a deposit. The demo trading feature allows sufficient testing prior to real trading to ensure that you’re comfortable using the platform. Once you’re feeling confident and up-to-speed, then feel free to make the deposit and begin making real money.</p>
        <h2 class="dark-purple bold how-it-works-header">low deposit</h2>
        <p>Activating an account with Bitcoin Era requires a deposit from as little as $250, although higher deposits are recommended.

                    <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n="">
                        In simple terms, bitcoin trading is the buying and selling of bitcoin. As a relatively new entrant into the global market, it has significant volatility, creating the possibility of benefiting from considerably high profits.

                    <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n="">
                        Due to the volatility surrounding bitcoin, it has great potential of rising quickly in a short amount of time, meaning immediate profit on your investment. Traditional currencies also change in value; however this usually happens in much smaller increments, which requires a lot of time, patience and money to see any form of profit.
